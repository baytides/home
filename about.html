              <p>
                At Bay Tides, we're passionate about protecting the natural beauty and health of the
                San Francisco Bay. While our primary focus is on the Peninsula, our mission is to
                mobilize individuals in our local community to take an active role in preserving the
                Bay Area's shoreline and ecosystem.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through hands-on projects, educational programs, and collaborative conservation
                efforts, we empower residents to make a meaningful impact in their backyard.

            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
              Founded in 2023, Bay Tides is a community-driven nonprofit dedicated to fostering
              environmental stewardship on the Peninsula of the San Francisco Bay Area, while
              remaining mindful of the broader Bay Area.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe the best way to protect our cherished shoreline is through local action in
              three key areas:
              <strong>Educate</strong>
              ,
              <strong>Advocate</strong>
              , and
              <strong>Action</strong>
              . By connecting community members of all ages with opportunities to learn, volunteer,
              and engage, we're building a grassroots movement rooted in respect for our environment
              and a commitment to its preservation.

              <p>
                We believe that knowledge is the foundation of change. Through workshops, community
                partnerships, and public programs, we provide accessible education on environmental
                issues, conservation practices, and the critical role of the bay.
              </p>
              <p>
                By raising awareness, we inspire individuals to take ownership of their impact on
                the bay.

                Our advocacy efforts empower residents to champion policies and initiatives that
                protect the bay's future. We engage with local leaders, collaborate with
                environmental organizations, and encourage community members to raise their voices
                for sustainable solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Together, we aim to drive systemic change that ensures long-term protection of our
                cherished shoreline.

                Taking action is at the heart of our mission. From habitat restoration projects to
                volunteer-led conservation efforts, we mobilize our community to make a tangible
                difference.

            <h2>Why Our Work Matters</h2>
            <p>
              The San Francisco Bay is more than just a natural landmark&mdash;it's a vital
              ecosystem that protects critical and endangered wildlife and enriches our community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet, this ecosystem faces ongoing, life-altering threats from human-induced pollution,
              climate change, and habitat loss. At Bay Tides, we believe that protecting the bay
              starts with each of us.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
              With your support, we can ensure a thriving, resilient Bay Area for generations to
              come.
