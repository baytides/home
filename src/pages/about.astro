            <p>
              At Bay Tides, we use technology to protect the natural environment and health of the
              San Francisco Bay. Our mission is to mobilize individuals in our local community to
              take an active role in preserving the Bay Area's shoreline and ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through digital tools, educational programs, and community mobilization, we empower
              residents to make a meaningful impact in their backyard.

            <p>
              We want everyone to help protect the Bay. You can make a difference right where you

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 2023, Bay Tides is a community-driven nonprofit dedicated to fostering
          environmental stewardship in the San Francisco Bay Area.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe the best way to protect our cherished shoreline is through local action in
          three key areas:
          <strong>Educate</strong>,
          <strong>Mobilize</strong>, and
          <strong>Innovate</strong>. By connecting community members of all ages with opportunities
          to learn, take action, and build digital tools, we're building a grassroots movement
          rooted in respect for our environment and a commitment to its preservation.

            We believe that knowledge is the foundation of change. Through workshops, community
            partnerships, and public programs, we provide accessible education on environmental
            issues, conservation practices, and the critical role of the bay.
          </p>
          <p>
            By raising awareness, we inspire individuals to take ownership of their impact on the
            bay.

            We empower residents to make a real difference—whether that's volunteering for habitat
            restoration, cleaning up pollution, or championing policies that protect the bay's
            future.
          </p>

            By connecting residents with opportunities to act and speak up, we drive change on the

            We harness technology to amplify our environmental impact. Through open-source digital

            with resources that support both their wellbeing and the planet.

            By building privacy-first, accessible technology, we ensure innovation serves everyone

        <h2>Why Our Work Matters</h2>
        <p>
          The San Francisco Bay is more than just a natural landmark&mdash;it's a vital ecosystem
          that protects critical and endangered wildlife and enriches our community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, this ecosystem faces ongoing, life-altering threats from human-induced pollution,
          climate change, and habitat loss. At Bay Tides, we believe that protecting the bay starts
          with each of us.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
          With your support, we can ensure a thriving, resilient Bay Area for generations to come.
