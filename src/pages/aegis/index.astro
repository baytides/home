        <p>
          The Aegis Initiative connects veterans and service members with meaningful opportunities
          to protect the San Francisco Bay. Named for the shield of ancient protectors, Aegis
          recognizes that those who served our nation bring valuable skills, leadership, and purpose
          to defending our local environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Veterans lead here, not just participate. We welcome service members of all backgrounds
          and skill levels. If you want to be part of something purposeful, there's a place for you.

        <h2>Join the Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Bay Tides uses technology to educate communities, mobilize residents, and innovate
          solutions for environmental challenges. Aegis participants join that mission, bringing
          military experience in project management, logistics, communications, data analysis,
          engineering, and leadership to conservation work that matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          In return, you gain hands-on environmental sector experience, opportunities to lead
          outdoor programs for fellow veterans, a peer community working toward shared purpose, and
          connections to Bay Area environmental organizations. Your contributions here build real
          credentials for civilian careers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants shape Aegis itself, from leading Bay hikes and restoration events to
          contributing technical skills on monitoring projects. As a small nonprofit, every
          contribution has outsized impact.
