            This document outlines our procedures for receiving, evaluating, and responding to legal

            Bay Tides requires <strong>valid legal process</strong> before disclosing any information
            related to the Tipline. We do not honor informal requests, verbal requests, or requests that
            lack proper legal authority.
          </p>
          <p>The types of legal process we recognize include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Subpoena</strong> — A valid subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction
              or authorized government body
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Court order</strong> — An order issued by a judge under applicable legal standards
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Search warrant</strong> — A warrant issued by a judge upon a showing of probable
              cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and describing with particularity the information
              to be disclosed
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>All legal process must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Be issued by a court or agency with proper jurisdiction</li>
            <li>Identify the specific information sought with particularity</li>
            <li>Be properly served on Bay Tides</li>
            <li>Comply with all applicable legal requirements</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Bay Tides will <strong>challenge or seek to narrow</strong> any request that is overly broad,
            legally deficient, or appears to be a fishing expedition.

            The Tipline is designed with <strong>data minimization</strong> as a core principle. As a
            result, the information Bay Tides can provide in response to valid legal process is limited
            to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The text content of a specific submission (if still retained)</li>

            <li>
              Messages exchanged through the platform's anonymous messaging system (if still
              retained)
            </li>
            <li>The date and time a submission was received</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All of the above is information that the submitter voluntarily provided. We do not
            possess any additional information beyond what was submitted.

            Due to the privacy-by-design architecture of the Tipline, Bay Tides <strong>

            </strong>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>IP addresses</strong> — Not logged or stored at any point</li>
            <li>
              <strong>User identities</strong> — The platform is anonymous; we do not require or collect

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Browser or device information</strong> — No fingerprinting, no user agent logging
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Connection metadata</strong> — No timestamps of connections (only submission timestamps),
              no session data
            </li>
            <li><strong>Geolocation data</strong> — Not collected in any form</li>

            Bay Tides is committed to transparency about law enforcement interactions with the
            Tipline. To that end:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We will publish periodic transparency reports disclosing the number and type of law
              enforcement requests received, to the extent permitted by law
            </li>
            <li>
              Reports will include aggregate data such as: number of requests received, number of
              requests complied with, number of requests challenged, and types of legal process
              received
            </li>
            <li>
              Transparency reports will not include information that could identify specific
              submitters or compromise ongoing investigations
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As of the effective date of this document, Bay Tides has received <strong>zero</strong> law
            enforcement requests for Tipline data.

          <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
          <p>
            Bay Tides takes a firm stance on protecting Tipline user privacy when it comes to law
            enforcement requests:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>We require <strong>valid legal process</strong> — no informal requests honored</li>
            <li>
              We <strong>can't share what we don't have</strong> — no IPs, no identities, no metadata
            </li>
            <li>We will <strong>notify affected users</strong> when legally permitted</li>
            <li>We will <strong>challenge overly broad requests</strong></li>
            <li>We publish <strong>transparency reports</strong> on requests received</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As of today, we have received <strong>zero</strong> law enforcement requests for Tipline data.
