        <hr />

        <h2 id="privacy-commitment">2. Our Privacy Commitment</h2>
        <p>
          We believe in
          <strong>privacy-by-design</strong>
          and
          <strong>data minimization</strong>. This means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We collect only the minimum information necessary to provide our services</li>
          <li>We do not use cookies for tracking or advertising</li>
          <li>We do not display targeted advertisements</li>
          <li>
            We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with advertisers or data
            brokers
          </li>
          <li>We do not create user profiles or track behavior across websites</li>
          <li>We use privacy-focused analytics that collects no personal data</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="info-not-collected">3. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>
          To be absolutely clear about our privacy practices, here is what we explicitly do
          <strong>NOT</strong>
          collect:
        </p>

        <h3>Personal Identifiers (Unless Voluntarily Provided)</h3>
        <p>
          We do not automatically collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, postal addresses,
          Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, or any government-issued ID numbers.
          The only personal information we receive is what you voluntarily submit through our
          contact or donation forms.
        </p>

        <h3>Online Identifiers</h3>
        <p>
          Our systems do not log IP addresses, create device fingerprints, collect MAC addresses,
          generate browser fingerprints, or track unique device identifiers. While our hosting
          provider (GitHub Pages) and CDN (Cloudflare) may collect IP addresses for security
          purposes, we do not have access to these logs and do not request or receive this
          information.
        </p>

        <h3>Behavioral Data</h3>
        <p>
          We do not track or collect browsing history, search history, detailed page view
          statistics, time-on-page metrics, click patterns, mouse movements, or scroll depth. Our
          analytics only measure aggregate, anonymous metrics.
        </p>

        <h3>Demographic Information</h3>
        <p>
          We do not collect or infer age, gender, race, ethnicity, income level, employment status,
          education level, marital status, or household size.
        </p>

        <h3>Protected Categories</h3>
        <p>
          We do not collect health information, financial information (beyond donation processing),
          biometric data, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, or political affiliations.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="info-collected">4. Information We May Collect</h2>
        <p>
          We only collect personal information that you
          <strong>voluntarily provide</strong>
          when you:
        </p>

        <h3>Contact Forms</h3>
        <p>
          When you submit our contact form, we receive your name, email address, selected topic, and
          message content. This information is processed by Web3Forms and forwarded to us via email.
        </p>

        <h3>Newsletter Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>
          When you subscribe to our newsletter, we receive your email address. You can unsubscribe
          at any time.
        </p>

        <h3>Donations</h3>
        <p>
          When you make a donation through Donorbox, we receive your name, email, and donation
          amount for record-keeping and tax receipt purposes.
          <strong>We do not receive or store your payment card information</strong>
          - this is handled securely by Donorbox.
        </p>

        <h3>Volunteer Registration</h3>
        <p>
          When you register for volunteer events, we collect the information you provide to
          coordinate activities and communicate with you.
        </p>

        <h2 id="how-website-works">5. How the Website Works</h2>

        <h3>Client-Side Local Storage Only</h3>
        <p>
          This website uses your browser's
          <strong>local storage</strong>
          exclusively for functionality preferences. Local storage:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stays only on your device</li>
          <li>Is never transmitted to our servers</li>
          <li>Is never seen by us or any third party</li>
          <li>Can be cleared by you at any time through your browser settings</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What is stored locally:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Theme preference</strong>
            (Light/Dark mode) - a simple CSS preference string
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>How to clear this data:</strong>
          You can clear local storage through your browser settings under "Cookies and Site Data" or "Clear
          browsing data."
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Browser Display Note:</strong>
          Some browsers display local storage under "Cookies" in their settings interface. This is a browser
          UI grouping, not an indication that we use cookies. Local storage is technically distinct from
          HTTP cookies: it is never sent to our servers with requests, cannot be read by us, and does
          not track you across websites.
        </p>

        <h3>No User Accounts</h3>
        <p>
          We do not offer user accounts, sign-in features, or require registration to access our
          website content.
        </p>

          <strong>Status:</strong>
          Currently ENABLED
        </p>

        <p>
          We use a
          <strong>self-hosted version of Plausible Analytics</strong>
          to understand basic usage patterns and improve our website. Unlike many analytics services,
          Plausible collects only essential, aggregated metrics with strict privacy protections.
        </p>

        <h3>What We Measure</h3>
        <p>
          We measure only the following aggregate metrics that do
          <strong>NOT</strong>
          identify individuals:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unique and total site visitor counts</li>
          <li>Country of origin (country level only, not city or region)</li>
          <li>Browser type (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)</li>
          <li>Operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, iOS, Android)</li>
          <li>Referral sources (how visitors found our site)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What We Do NOT Collect</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>IP Addresses:</strong>
            No IP addresses are collected, logged, or stored
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Personally Identifiable Information:</strong>
            No names, emails, or any personal identifiers
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Session Identifiers:</strong>
            No session tokens, cookies, or user tracking IDs
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Device Fingerprints:</strong>
            No unique device identifiers or fingerprinting data
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Behavioral Details:</strong>
            No page-by-page tracking, click tracking, or time-on-page metrics
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technical Privacy Measures</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>No Cookies:</strong>

          </li>

            <strong>No Cross-Site Tracking:</strong>
            Data is not tracked across multiple websites
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No User Profiles:</strong>
            No individual user profiles or histories are maintained
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>HTTPS Encryption:</strong>
            All data transmission is encrypted
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="cookies-tracking">8. Cookies and Tracking</h2>

        <h3>This Website Does NOT Use Cookies</h3>
        <p>We do not use cookies for any purpose. This means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No tracking cookies</li>
          <li>No advertising cookies</li>
          <li>No third-party cookies</li>
          <li>No cookie consent banners are needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why We Don't Use Cookies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Cookies can track users across sessions and websites, creating privacy concerns</li>
          <li>
            Our website uses local storage for essential functionality, which is more
            privacy-friendly
          </li>
          <li>People visiting our site deserve privacy without tracking</li>
          <li>
            Not using cookies simplifies the user experience and eliminates complex consent
            management
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Do Not Track (DNT) Signals</h3>
        <p>
          Since we do not track users under any circumstances, DNT signals are unnecessary but fully
          respected. We implement a universal "do not track" policy regardless of browser settings.
        </p>

        <h3>Global Privacy Control (GPC)</h3>
        <p>
          We respect Global Privacy Control signals. Since we do not sell or share personal
          information, GPC compliance is automatic.
