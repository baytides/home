            The tipline platform implements multiple layers of security to protect submitted
            information:
          </p>
          <div class="subsection">
            <h4>Encryption</h4>
            <p>
              All submissions are encrypted using industry-standard cryptographic methods. Data is
              encrypted both in transit (via Tor's layered encryption) and at rest on the server.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            <h4>Network Security</h4>
            <p>
              The tipline is accessible via the Tor network, which routes your connection through
              multiple encrypted relays to prevent network surveillance. This ensures that no
              observer — including Bay Tides — can determine your network identity.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            <h4>Access Controls</h4>
            <p>
              Access to submitted reports is restricted to authorized Bay Tides personnel on a
              need-to-know basis. We maintain strict internal controls on who can view submissions.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            <h4>Infrastructure Isolation</h4>
            <p>
              The tipline runs in an isolated environment, separated from Bay Tides' other services
              and systems. This ensures that a compromise of any other service does not affect the
              tipline.

            We retain submitted reports only for as long as necessary to review and act on the

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Active reports</strong> are retained while under review or investigation
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resolved reports</strong> are deleted within a reasonable timeframe after the matter
              is concluded
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Submitter-requested deletion:</strong> If you retained your receipt code, you may
              request that your submission be deleted at any time by contacting us through the platform's
              messaging system
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When data is deleted, it is permanently removed from our systems. We do not maintain

            <h4>Receipt Code Access</h4>
            <p>
              When you submit a report, you receive a unique receipt code. This code allows you to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Access your submission and any responses from Bay Tides</li>
              <li>Send follow-up messages or additional information</li>
              <li>Request that your submission be deleted</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Important:</strong> Your receipt code is the only way to access your submission.
              We cannot recover it if lost, as we have no way to verify your identity.

              If you are a California resident and have identifiable information in your submission,
              you have the right to:

              <li>Know what personal information we hold about you</li>

            The tipline is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
            personal information from children under 13 in compliance with the Children's Online
            Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the tipline is anonymous, we generally cannot determine the age of submitters.
            If we become aware that a submission was made by a child under 13 and contains personal
            information, we will handle the matter with additional care and delete any personal
            information as appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has submitted personal
            information through the tipline, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and we will work
            to address your concerns.
