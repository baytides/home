            Bay Tides takes extensive measures to protect the anonymity and security of Tipline
            users, as described in our <a href="/tipline-privacy">Tipline Privacy Policy</a>.
            However, you should be aware of the following:

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>No absolute guarantee:</strong> While we implement strong security measures, no
              system can guarantee absolute security or anonymity. Sophisticated adversaries with sufficient
              resources may attempt to compromise any system.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Use Tor:</strong> For maximum anonymity, we strongly recommend accessing the Tipline

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Receipt code responsibility:</strong> Your receipt code is the only means of accessing
              your submission. Keep it secure and private. We cannot recover lost receipt codes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Content awareness:</strong> Be mindful of information you include in submissions
