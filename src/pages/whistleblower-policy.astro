            Bay Tides is committed to transparency, accountability, and environmental stewardship.
            We recognize that people with knowledge of environmental concerns may face barriers to
            speaking up — whether due to fear of retaliation, uncertainty about whom to tell, or
            lack of a secure channel.
          </p>
          <p>
            This policy establishes Bay Tides' framework for receiving, handling, and acting on
            reports of environmental concerns. It applies to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Members of the public reporting environmental concerns in the San Francisco Bay Area

            <li>Bay Tides volunteers, staff, board members, and contractors</li>
            <li>
              Employees or affiliates of other organizations who wish to report environmental issues
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Anyone may submit a report, regardless of their relationship (or lack thereof) to Bay
            Tides.

            <li>
              <strong>Ecosystem threats</strong> — Activities that endanger wetlands, wildlife habitats,

            </li>
            <li>

          <p>
            If you are unsure whether your concern is relevant, we encourage you to report it. We
            would rather receive a report that turns out to be outside our scope than miss a genuine
            environmental threat.

          <p>Bay Tides provides multiple channels for reporting environmental concerns:</p>
          <div class="subsection">
            <h4>Secure Tipline (Recommended for Anonymity)</h4>
            <p>
              Our secure tipline is accessible through the Tor network and provides the strongest
              anonymity protections. It allows you to submit reports without revealing your
              identity, and to communicate with Bay Tides using an anonymous receipt code.
            </p>
            <p>
              For maximum security, access the tipline using the
              <a
                href="https://www.torproject.org/download/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >
                Tor Browser

          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            <h4>Contact Form</h4>
            <p>
              You can also reach us through our <a href="/contact">contact page</a>. Note that this
              channel does not provide the same level of anonymity as the secure tipline, as
              standard web connections may reveal your IP address and other metadata.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Anonymous reporting is fully supported and encouraged when you have concerns about
            identifying yourself. You do not need to provide your name or any contact information to
            submit a report.

            Protecting the identity of reporters is fundamental to our tipline. We implement

          </p>
          <div class="subsection">
            <h4>Technical Measures</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Tor network access</strong> — The tipline is accessible as a Tor hidden service,
                preventing network-level identification
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Zero metadata collection</strong> — No IP addresses, browser fingerprints, cookies,
                or analytics
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>End-to-end encryption</strong> — Submissions are encrypted in transit and at rest
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Anonymous messaging</strong> — The receipt code system allows two-way communication
                without revealing identity
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            <h4>Organizational Measures</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Need-to-know access</strong> — Only authorized personnel can view submissions
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No identity investigation</strong> — We do not attempt to determine the identity
                of anonymous reporters
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Confidential handling</strong> — Report details are not shared beyond those directly
                involved in review
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Secure communications</strong> — Internal discussions about reports follow strict

            Bay Tides maintains a <strong>zero-tolerance policy against retaliation</strong> toward anyone
            who makes a good-faith report of an environmental concern or participates in the investigation
            of a report.
          </p>
          <p>This non-retaliation commitment applies to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bay Tides volunteers, staff, board members, and contractors</li>
            <li>Anyone who submits a report through any of our reporting channels</li>
            <li>Anyone who cooperates with or assists in the review of a report</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Retaliation includes, but is not limited to: termination, demotion, suspension, threats,
            harassment, intimidation, or any other adverse action taken because of a good-faith
            report.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you believe you have experienced retaliation for making a report, please notify Bay
            Tides immediately through any of our reporting channels.

              You will receive a unique receipt code upon submission. This code allows you to check

          <div class="subsection">
            <h4>2. Initial Review</h4>
            <p>
              Authorized Bay Tides personnel will review the report to assess its nature, urgency,
              and relevance to our environmental mission. We aim to complete initial review within a
              reasonable timeframe.
            </p>

          <div class="subsection">
            <h4>3. Investigation</h4>
            <p>
              If the report warrants further action, we may conduct research, gather publicly
              available information, or consult with relevant experts. We may also contact you
              through the platform to request additional details.

          <div class="subsection">
            <h4>4. Action</h4>

              public advocacy, referrals to regulatory agencies, community alerts, investigative
              reporting partnerships, or internal corrective measures (for reports concerning Bay

            While Bay Tides takes all reports seriously, it is important to understand the following
            limitations:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>We are not law enforcement.</strong> Bay Tides is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.
              We do not have enforcement authority, subpoena power, or the ability to compel action by
              other parties.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No guaranteed outcomes.</strong> We cannot guarantee that any specific action will
              be taken in response to a report, or that a reported concern will be resolved in a particular
              way.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Scope limitations.</strong> Our mission focuses on the San Francisco Bay Area environment.
              Reports outside this scope may be referred to more appropriate organizations if possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resource constraints.</strong> As a nonprofit, our capacity to investigate and act
              on reports is limited by our available resources and personnel.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No legal advice.</strong> Bay Tides does not provide legal counsel. If you need
              legal advice regarding environmental violations or whistleblower protections, please consult
              an attorney.

          <p>
            All reports submitted through the tipline must be made in <strong>good faith</strong>.
            This means:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You genuinely believe the information you are reporting is true and accurate to the
              best of your knowledge
            </li>
            <li>
              You are not submitting reports with the intent to harass, defame, or cause harm to
              individuals or organizations
            </li>
            <li>You are not submitting deliberately false or fabricated information</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Good faith does not require certainty. If you have a reasonable belief that something is
            wrong, we want to hear about it — even if you are not sure of all the details. It is
            better to report a concern that turns out to be unfounded than to stay silent about a
            genuine threat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowingly false reports waste resources that could be used to address real environmental
            concerns and may be subject to removal from the platform.
