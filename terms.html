                PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR
                RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
              </strong>
            </p>

            <h3>12.1 Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
            <p>
              You and Bay Tides agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or
              relating to these Terms, our Services, or any aspect of your relationship with Bay
              Tides (collectively, "Disputes") will be resolved exclusively through final and
              binding individual arbitration, rather than in court, except as set forth below.
            </p>

            <h3>12.2 Waiver of Class Actions</h3>
            <p>
              YOU AND BAY TIDES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR
              ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS,
              COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Bay Tides agree otherwise,
              the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside
              over any form of class, collective, or representative proceeding.
            </p>

            <h3>12.3 Informal Resolution First</h3>
            <p>
              Before initiating arbitration, you agree to first contact us at our website contact
              form to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. We will attempt to resolve the
              dispute by contacting you via email. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within
              thirty (30) days, either party may proceed to arbitration.
            </p>

            <h3>12.4 Arbitration Procedures</h3>
            <p>
              Any arbitration shall be administered by JAMS under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules
              and Procedures, as modified by this agreement. The arbitration will be conducted by a
              single neutral arbitrator. The arbitration shall take place in San Mateo County,
              California, or at another mutually agreed location, or via videoconference if agreed
              by the parties.
            </p>

            <h3>12.5 Arbitration Fees</h3>
            <p>
              Each party shall initially bear its own filing fees and share equally in the
              arbitrator's fees. However, if you prevail in the arbitration, Bay Tides will
              reimburse your filing fees and pay the full arbitrator's fees for disputes involving
              $5,000 or less. For disputes involving more than $5,000, the arbitrator shall
              determine the allocation of fees based on the outcome and merits of the case.
            </p>

            <h3>12.6 Exceptions to Arbitration</h3>
            <p>
              Either party may bring an individual action in small claims court for disputes within
              the court's jurisdiction. Additionally, either party may seek injunctive or other
              equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or
              threatened infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights.
            </p>

            <h3>12.7 Opt-Out</h3>
            <p>
              You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending written notice to Bay Tides
              via our contact form within fourteen (14) days of first using our Services. Your
              notice must include your name, address, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out
              of this arbitration agreement. If you opt out, you will not be precluded from using
              our Services, but this arbitration agreement will not apply to you.
            </p>

            <h3>12.8 Survival</h3>
            <p>
              This arbitration agreement will survive termination of your relationship with Bay
              Tides and your use of our Services.
            </p>

              these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including

              liability.
            </p>

            <h2>17. Severability</h2>
            <p>
              If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that

              remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
            </p>

            <h2>18. Entire Agreement</h2>
            <p>
              These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any other legal notices or
              agreements published by us on the Site, constitute the entire agreement between you
              and Bay Tides concerning your use of the Services and supersede all prior agreements
              and understandings.

            <h2>19. Waiver</h2>
            <p>
              Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a
